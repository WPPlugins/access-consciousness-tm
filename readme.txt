Searches for Access Consciousness&reg; registered trademarks in content, excerpt, titles, etc. and appends the &reg; suffix.

== Description ==

The plugin searches content, excerpt, titles, link names, and link descriptions for Access Consciousness&reg; registered trademarks (in French and English) and appends the &reg; suffix. The suffix is wrapped with an HTML span tag and a class name of "acreg". As an example, you can use the following CSS to position and size the suffix text.

<pre>
.acreg {
        vertical-align:top;
        font-weight:normal;
        font-size:0.8em;
}
h1 .acreg, h2 .acreg, h3 .acreg, h4 .acreg {
        font-weight:normal;
        font-size:0.7em;
}
</pre>
